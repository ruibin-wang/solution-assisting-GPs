He, however, returned with ongoing back pain and fevers. \n\nPrior to this admission, the patient lived with his wife and was able to mobilize independently with a rolator. Since the first admission, he has lost the ability to move due to reduced power and can only transfer from bed to chair. Furthermore, he has noticed a decrease in his arm power. There is a long-term SPC in situ. On examination today, there is 4-5 power on extension and 1-5 power on flexion unilaterally. The tone is normal, and sensation was inconsistent but generally reduced bilaterally from the knees towards the distal part. Reflexes were brisk on the right side. There are no signs of infection currently. \n\nThe patient is concerned that his MS is flaring up; therefore, we would appreciate your input and whether you feel methylpred, for example, would be useful, or further imaging of the spine. \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

Mr. Johnson was admitted to our hospital with a severe headache, which he described as a dull ache with intermittent sharp stabbing pains above his right eye.\n\nWhile originally diagnosed with sinusitis due to tenderness around the right maxillary sinus, a CT scan has revealed no abnormalities in his sinuses or brain parenchyma. Furthermore, Mr. Johnson underwent a maxillofacial review, which determined that there is no dental cause for his pain.\n\nDespite our efforts to identify the cause of Mr. Johnson's headaches, his pain persists, and we are eager to seek your expertise to help in his diagnosis and review.

On subsequent imaging arranged by medics, the patient was thought to have an underdeveloped right ant cerebral and so possibly unilateral ant cir supply. On the last neuro-rad MDT discussion, LP was suggested.\n\nI am hoping you could see the patient before Tuesday 27 March, and provide any necessary follow-up care.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your name and title] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

His history includes previous CVE-TIA, stroke (1990s), dementia, CVA, hyponatremia, and right extra-capsular trochanteric fracture. His diagnosis was left MCA infarct, likely cardioembolic secondary to new AF. Due to his frailty, apixaban was not recommended, and he was outside the thrombolysis window.\n\nThe patient's current problem is bilateral upper limb contractures, which is causing him significant pain and distress. Baclofen was trialed, but relatives have reported that the patient is becoming increasingly drowsy. Therapy splinting has been tried, but the report indicates no improvement.

There was no headache, double vision, limb weakness-numbness-speech disturbance-visual loss. However, on neurological examination, he had right-sided droop and right-sided nystagmus. Additionally, a previous head injury from multiple car crashes many years ago had led to diagnoses of old ischemic areas and mild degrees of cerebellar volume loss. The current admission found very high blood pressure (210-105), not previously diagnosed as hypertensive. GTN infusion was started, and an ECG demonstrated LVH. The patient was treated as an acute stroke case.\n\nAfter investigating further and taking over care from the post take team, we discovered our patient had alarming MRI and MRA results. For these reasons, we believe it's in the patient's best interest to be seen by neurology make sure that nothing more sinister is going on.

The patient, a middle-aged male, presented with symptoms of sudden onset dizziness that felt like being in a boat, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, as well as left-sided neck pain. No headache, double vision, limb weakness-numbness-speech disturbance-visual loss was observed. The patient had multiple crashes when racing cars many years ago, which resulted in a head injury. Upon examination, right-sided nystagmus and right-sided droop were observed, and the retina was not able to be clearly viewed on fundoscopy. The patient's ECG showed LVH, and a CTB demonstrated old ischemic areas and mild degrees of cerebellar volume loss, with no vascular oedema or SOL or acute ICH. Lipid profile was normal. Following admission, the patient was treated for acute stroke, and further tests, including an MRI head and MRA neck, have been conducted. Given the patient's unusual presentation and relatively young age, we believe it is prudent to rule out any more severe underlying pathology.

This lady had a traumatic fall down 15 steps and hit her head, but she recovered from this injury. However, 12 days ago, she developed pain in her left leg, shooting pain from her lower back all the way down the left leg to the foot. One to two weeks ago, she started to experience gradual weakness in her left leg, to the point where she had to drag her left leg and had two falls. She then developed weakness and numbness in her left arm, but she was able to move the arm. Three to seven days ago, she lost vision completely in her left eye, which has since returned to blurred vision.\n\nShe attended RBH and had normal MRI brain and whole spine, as well as a normal eye examination. However, she self-discharged prior to neuro review as there was a problem with ward staff. She presented to Poole with leg weakness. On examination today, she has patchy decreased sensation on the left side of her face, left hand, and minimal decreased sensation on her left forearm, which is again patchy. She has decreased power 2-5 in her left leg, and there is shooting pain ++ on passive left ankle flexion and leg raise. Her eye movements are normal, and her CN examination is normal.\n\nWe have reassured her that a structural cause for weakness and numbness has been excluded with the normal MRI scans and that this may be a functional problem secondary to her previous fall three to twelve weeks ago. We have commenced gabapentin for the nerve type pain and have asked physio to review. We would greatly appreciate your review to determine if this is a functional weakness or whether any other investigation or treatment may be necessary.\n\nThank you for your help in managing this patient.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

The reason for this referral is that we require your advice regarding the need for further investigation in light of a raised CSF protein level.\n\nThe patient was admitted on 14-04-18 with the onset of right-sided neck pain, which then progressed to whole neck pain and finally severe pain at the base of the skull. Upon admission, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.4 and had a raised CRP level of 249. The patient has a GCS of 15-15, with no confusion noted to date, no seizures, and no focal neurology. A CT brain scan was normal and an MRI brain scan was unremarkable. The MRI C-spine showed spondylitic changes only, with no evidence of infective discs, and no compressive myelopathy or cord compression. A vasculitic screen was normal, and the Rheumatology team was satisfied that no systemic process was accounting for his presentation.\n\nAn LP was performed on 15-04-18, which was documented as traumatic, with the first bottle being blood-stained, and showing a CSF protein level of 1.74 and a cell count of WBC (Bottle 1) <1 X 10^6-L and RBC (Bottle 1) 722 X 10^6-L. No bacterial growth was observed on the Gram stain. We have sent the SCF for viral screening. The patient was commenced on antibiotics for sepsis of unknown origin, although viral meningitis has not been excluded yet.\n\nIn light of the patient's raised CSF protein level, we would like to know whether this could be explained by the traumatic nature of the LP or viral meningitis, or if further investigations are warranted. We should note that the patient has continued to improve since being on antibiotics and since stopping same on 20-04-18.\n\nWe would be grateful for your advice concerning this matter.

He was agitated with confused speech on admission and was treated for encephalitis. He was admitted to ICU on 21-1-18 after his GCS dropped further and he was unable to maintain his airway and was intubated and started on leviteracetam. Subclinical seizures were suspected, and so he was loaded on phenytoin and tazocin started. Imaging with CT and MRI revealed no clear cause for this presentation. On 30-1-18, he was reviewed by Dr. Page who felt that he most likely had a metabolic encephalopathy. He was then seen by the elderly care consultants on ICU who felt that he had a grave outcome and so he was extubated and transferred from ITU to a medical ward. He became chesty with a raised temperature and was treated for a ventilator-acquired pneumonia briefly before he deteriorated further, and it was decided to palliate him. Over the past week, he became more alert and started speaking, and so after discussion with his children, it was decided to stop palliative care. He has started to have therapy with the ward therapists only yesterday. They have concerns about the neurological and functional recovery of this previously independent man. They have had a discussion with our consultant, and it was decided that your expertise would be of benefit Dr. Burn.

The MSU showed a sensitivity to gentamicin, and the patient is currently on day 5 of gentamicin + IVI, and is improving in this regard. The patient has a background of Parkinson's disease and psychotic depression and was previously on madopar, but was switched to sinemet 187.5mg TDS whilst in St. Anne's due to associated weight loss and diarrhea.\n\nThe patient was last reviewed by you, and you believed there had been some improvement since the reduction in aripiprazole, but did not feel an increase in sinemet would be helpful. On the current admission, the patient has been withdrawn and difficult to communicate with, and thus difficult to assess motor function. A review by liason psychiatry noted the patient being extremely blunted in affect secondary to psychotic depression- delirium. However, since receiving her usual aripiprazole over the weekend, the patient seems less withdrawn.\n\nSeen by PD nurse Lynette, who suggested that a review by you whilst an inpatient would be appropriate.

Mr. [Patient's name], a 56-year-old man, was initially admitted with a posterior circulation stroke that unfortunately developed further small infarcts bilaterally in the cerebrum. Following investigations, he was treated for possible temporal arteritis in Great Yarmouth, which was ruled out after a negative biopsy. However, he has recently weaned himself off his prednisolone, and his visual symptoms and headache have returned. Following consultation with the ophthalmologists in Bournemouth, who have considered TA again, he has restarted prednisolone at 80mg. Our concern is that the whole picture of the strokes and visual symptoms may be related to a vasculitis. Although the rheumatology team is treating him for possible TA, we would be very grateful for your opinion on this case. Additionally, Mr. [Patient's Name] has a dilative cardiomyopathy that we were concerned could be leading to thromboembolic disease, but echo and carotid dopplers have not shown significant evidence for this.

The patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who was admitted to our hospital on 14-04-18 with the onset of right-sided neck pain. The pain progressed to whole neck pain and then severe pain at the base of the skull, which was described as \"like it's going to explode.\" On admission, he had a fever of 38.4\u00baC and raised CRP levels (rising to 249). He had a GCS of 15-15, with no confusion noted to date, no seizures, and no focal neurology. CT and MRI brain scans were unremarkable, whereas the MRI C-spine showed spondylitic changes and no evidence of infective discs, and no compressive myelopathy or cord compression. The vasculitic screen was normal, and the Rheumatology team was satisfied that no systemic process accounted for his presentation. An LP was performed on 15-04-2018, which was documented as traumatic, with the first bottle being blood-stained, showing CSF protein levels of 1.74, with no bacterial growth on Gram stain. We have sent the CSF for viral screen and commenced the patient on antibiotics for sepsis of unknown origin, although viral meningitis has not been excluded as of yet. \n\nIn light of his raised CSF protein, we would appreciate your advice regarding whether this could be explained by the traumatic nature of the LP or viral meningitis, or if further investigations are indicated. Please could you kindly advise us on the best course of action. \n\nMany thanks in advance for your assistance. Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

Mrs. ________ is a 64-year-old female diagnosed with epilepsy and hypertension. Her last fit was 17 years ago, and she has been on an increasing dose of phenytoin for the past month due to low phenytoin levels.\n\nMrs. ________ presented with dizziness and mild frontal headache, followed by an unresponsive episode with right arm shaking for 2-3 minutes. She gradually recovered from it, but then had two more brief episodes of collapse and right arm shaking. Additionally, she experienced chest pain with dizzy spells and blurring of vision five days ago.\n\nA CT brain scan showed a 5 mm right MCA aneurysm, and her case will be discussed in a neurosurgical meeting tomorrow. A CT angiogram has also been requested per their advice. She is currently being treated for ACS as her troponin level was 58. Her phenytoin level was 2.7, so we have increased her phenytoin to 200mg.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could see Mrs. ________ for further evaluation and management of her syncope and collapse episodes.

Following treatment with antibiotics, the patient has stabilized and is currently in a more comfortable state.\n\nHowever, Mr. XXXX has a complicated history of spinocerebellar disease, which has led to poor swallow and associated deafness. Despite assessment by the SALT team, his swallow was deemed unsafe, and we considered an NGT. Unfortunately, the patient refused this treatment, and we are now concerned that he may lack capacity given his underlying condition. With no NOK to discuss with, we are looking to arrange an IMCA to carry out a best interests meeting regarding the appropriateness of an NJT.\n\nIn the meantime, for over two weeks, Mr. XXXX has only had stage 3 thickened fluids as advised by the SALT team, which he consumes very little of. We have supplied him with IV fluids to ensure he is not malnourished, but we feel we need a specialist opinion before moving forward with other options.\n\nWe request your specialist opinion to help facilitate the best interests decision, as we are unsure what the long term prognosis for Mr. XXXX would be at this time. Given his malnourished and frail state, we are hesitant to suggest an NJT without further clarification of the implications of his diagnosis. We are looking forward to hearing back from you.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Name of Referring Doctor] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

The patient was admitted to Ansty on 1-9-15 following a tonic-clonic seizure, which was thought to be secondary to low magnesium after starting Omeprazole 40mg QDS. The patient did not remember the events and had no prodromal symptoms. A CT Brain was performed, which showed no change in the size of the left MCA aneurysm, apart from a slight increase in calcification. There was no change elsewhere, but a small old right parietal infarct was noted. Magnesium was replaced IV, and omeprazole changed to ranitidine. \n\nThe patient was discharged, but since then, their family has noticed them becoming increasingly confused with reports of visual hallucinations. The patient became more restless and aggressive and was brought back to the hospital. On admission, the patient reported having visual hallucinations since discharge associated with a headache. There was no history of fever, speech-visual disturbance, focal weakness in extremities, SOB-cough-night sweats, or abdominal pain, but the patient complained of some dysuria. Throughout the day, the patient became increasingly confused and agitated and absconded from the hospital, very unsteady and unsafe on their feet, aggressive, and difficult to manage. \n\nThe patient was reviewed by the psychiatric team, which found them to be floridly psychotic. The patient had thought disorders, was disorientated in time, place, and person, and was paranoid (believing staff wanted to harm them). The patient appeared to experience auditory and visual hallucinations and clearly lacked capacity and became increasingly aggressive. They were given IM haloperidol 2.5mg initially, but this had little effect, so at MET Call was put out. On arrival, the patient needed a lot of encouragement and restraint to keep them in their room, and was grabbing their head and rolling around. They were therefore given 5mg IV of haloperidol, and their friend was then able to calm them somewhat. They were then brought up to ITU where they were Intubated and Ventilated to allow for a repeat CT Brain and Lumbar puncture for possible encephalitis. \n\nI would appreciate your advice on further investigations and management of this patient.

The patient, age 1-52, has a history of headaches and blurred vision, and was admitted in 2019 to RBH. CT brain on 25-02-2019 was NAD, MRI brain-MRV on 2-3-2019 was also NAD, and LP on 5-3-2019 showed a normal opening pressure; the patient was discharged home with tramadol. Since discharge, the patient has had left-sided headache, which has increased in severity, stabbing type pain with blurred vision. The patient reports that this headache is different from the original headache, which is usually a frontal headache like IIH headache. This headache started with a sharp pain in the left temporal area, but now it is a global pressure and heaviness. We have requested the anesthetic team to perform a blood patch however they currently do not wish to do this as they have no evidence this is required in the absence of low pressure features.  We have requested an MRI brain. Please could you review with regards to the ongoing complex headache with no symptom relief.

Following a failed TWOC, we have discussed Mr XXXX with your Urology team at RBH and it has been agreed that he will be reviewed as an outpatient.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr XXXX's neurology has not improved since admission. He currently feels weaker than on admission and is experiencing ongoing difficulties with leg spasms and numbness. I hope that your team will be able to provide the ongoing care and support that Mr XXXX requires.\n\nIf you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nKind regards,\n[Your name and designation] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

Our patient is a 76-year-old gentleman who was admitted to hospital on 14-04-18 with a fever of 38.4, and raised CRP levels (which rose to 249). Although his CT brain was normal, an unremarkable MRI brain scan revealed nothing out of the norm. An MRI C-spine showed only spondylitic changes, with no evidence of infective discs, cord compression or compressive myelopathy. He had no seizures or focal neurology, and his GCS has so far remained at 15-15 with no confusion noted to date. \n\nOn the 15-04-18, an LP was performed which was documented as traumatic, with the first bottle appearing blood-stained, while the second bottle contained a raised CSF protein level of 1.74. There were no bacterial growths detected in the Gram stain, though a viral meningitis was yet to be excluded at that point in time. Since then, our patient has continued to improve while on antibiotics for the sepsis of an unknown origin. However, we still have an outstanding question about whether this raised CSF protein level can be explained by the traumatic nature of the LP, viral meningitis or whether further investigations are needed; hence, our referral to you. \n\nWe seek your opinion on what the next steps should be to ensure our patient gets comprehensive care in the management of his sepsis of an unknown origin.

The baby boy was admitted to our hospital following seven episodes of abnormal movement over the previous 24-48 hours. In these episodes, his face turned red, his eyes were staring (sometimes off to the left), and he became stiff with possible slight shaking. These episodes are associated with either breathing fast or breath holding for 1-2 seconds. They all resolved spontaneously and lasted around 20 seconds, and he returned back to his normal self quickly after each episode and was moving his arms and legs normally. There was no obvious preceding cause or trigger, and he had never had any episodes like this before.\n\nOn examination, he appeared alert and active with minor mild blanching spots over his chest and back. ENT-Cardio-Resp examination was normal, and he was afebrile. Neurological examination appeared appropriate for his age. He had normal tone, normal and symmetrical facial and limb movements. His eye movements were normal, and he was responding to sounds appropriately. He had an uncomplicated neonatal history, vaccinations were up-to-date, and there were no developmental concerns or family history of seizures.\n\nHe was admitted to the ward, underwent a number of investigations, and was started on IV ceftriaxone. Routine blood tests were unremarkable, and cultures from blood and CSF did not indicate infection. He continued to have seizures, as many as 12 episodes in 12 hours. An MRI was performed under GA, which did not show any cause for the seizures, and a prolonged EEG was performed, which was consistent with partial seizures of right temporal onset. The patient was started on carbamazepine, and since then, the seizures have stopped. The baby boy will increase the carbamazepine dose to a maintenance dose of 40mg BD (20ml), and he will be reviewed in our local pediatric consultant's clinic in Poole, as well as in Southampton.\n\nI am referring this patient to you to provide further management advice and any necessary support for future care.\n\nThank you for your attention in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

After magnesium was replaced IV and omeprazole was changed to ranitidine, the patient became normal and was discharged.

He absconded from the hospital and was brought back by a paramedic who knew him and was able to calm him down.

The patient lacked capacity and became increasingly aggressive.\n\nThe patient was initially given IM haloperidol 2.5mg which had little effect, so a MET Call was put out. On arrival, the patient was needing a lot of encouragement and restraint to keep him in his room, grabbing at his head and rolling around. The patient was given 5mg IV of haloperidol and his friend was then able to calm him somewhat. The patient was then brought up to ITU where he was intubated and ventilated to allow for a repeat CT Brain and lumbar puncture, with concern for encephalitis. \n\nI would greatly appreciate your assessment of this patient and advice on further investigations and management.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name and Signature] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

Mrs. XXXX was admitted after she was found on the floor and displayed aggression and hallucinations. Her Creatinine Kinase, CRP, and hyponatraemia were raised but have since normalized. Over the preceding months, she had multiple episodes of reduced cognition-consciousness. Despite undergoing various investigations that were all reportedly normal, she has not improved over the years. A recent MRI showed some white matter disease changes that are in keeping with small vessel disease, but little else. During her admission, she has had recurrent vacant episodes lasting hours and has become non-verbal except for screaming. Despite an EEG showing nothing abnormal, she continues to scream intermittently and is otherwise grimacing most of the time. We have not seen any clinical seizure activity. We believe that she is suffering from delirium, but we cannot rule out the possibility of a reversible condition.

The patient's primary complaint is bilateral lower limb weakness and left upper arm weakness. Their history includes a small cervical syrinx found in 2011 following a fall down the stairs, after which they were unable to move their lower limbs and underwent several years of rehabilitation. They have only been mobilizing independently for one year, and their most recent presentation was on 19-12-15, when they fell asleep in a chair and on waking, were unable to lift their left arm or both lower limbs. They initially reported urinary incontinence, which has now resolved, and they have no bowel symptoms.\n\nUpon clinical examination, they have normal tone in all limbs, apart from the left hand, which is held in flexion and resistant to movement, suggestive of longstanding spasticity. Their right arm has a power of 5-5, while their left arm has a power of 1-5. Their bilateral lower limbs have a power of 0-5 and are completely flaccid. Reflexes are normal throughout, and there is no clonus.\n\nThis patient has an unclear diagnosis from neurology, and given their history of unclear neurology, there may be an underlying psychological aspect to their condition.

Dorchester and Salisbury have investigated her condition, and in February 2014, she had a PPM inserted as she was found to have pauses. Ms. Doe has a history of epilepsy as a child but is currently not on any epilepsy medication. On July 14, 2016, she presented with two episodes of collapse and unconsciousness during the day, without warning symptoms - the longest lasting 30 minutes. On examination, her pulse was regular, neurology intact, and examination and bloods were unremarkable. A pacemaker check showed sinus rhythm at 65 bpm with no arrhythmias. During admission, Ms. Doe had an episode of unresponsiveness while sitting in a chair; this lasted for five minutes, and she maintained her own airway and cardiovascularly showed no observable issues. Although no evidence of seizure activity was observed, and her lower limbs were shaking, her GCS was 3-15 with resisting eye opening and actively resisting NP airway. After regaining consciousness, she proceeded to have normal conversations with her husband. The impression based on this episode is that there is a functional element to her unresponsiveness.\n\nPlease evaluate Ms. Jane Doe for her condition of urinary tract infection, site not specified.

She had several episodes of vomiting and diarrhea before admission, followed by neck pain and headache, and then bilateral leg weakness 4-5 with reduced reflexes and reduced sensation which was ascending.

The LP showed an increase in protein levels, while the glucose levels were normal. An MRI of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel lumbar posterior disc bulges, resulting in mild neural compromise. The MRI of the thoracic-cervical spine revealed marginal disc space narrowing at the C4-C5 and C5-C6 levels. A right posterolateral uncovertebral bar at C4-C5 and C5-C6, causing moderate narrowing of the right exiting foramen, was also noted.

She's an 88-year-old lady with a history of recurrent episodes of reduced cognition-consciousness dating as far back as 2010. She had an MRI which revealed some white matter disease change indicative of small vessel disease; however, this didn't explain her recent presentation of aggression and hallucinations. Despite being on lamotrigine for this condition, she was admitted to the hospital after being found unconscious on the floor. \n\nOur patient's condition initially appeared to improve slightly, but over a few days, she experienced recurrent vacant episodes lasting hours. Over time, she became non-verbal except for screaming intermittently, which till now, has persisted. We have treated her with limited evidence as cellulitis (due to the raised inflammatory markers and a slightly red leg), but after having ruled out the possibility of clinical seizure activity, we have treated her as delirium. An EEG performed during one of her episodes on the ward came out entirely normal. \n\nOur patient has seen both Elderly care physicians and a Psychiatrist, with limited success. Therefore we are writing to seek your perspective in case we have missed something potentially reversible. It is pertinent to mention that our patient has not had repeat neuroimaging since her MRI pre admission. This is because previous attempts at neuroimaging (with an MRCP) had to be abandoned due to her continual movement; therefore, sedation would be necessary. \n\nWe would be grateful if you could provide your opinion on the best course of action that could help with the management of our patient's condition.

He is known to Dr. Page but is not currently on any medication for these.\n\nGiven the severity and frequency of Mr. Doe's seizures, I feel that he would benefit from further evaluation by a specialist. I am hopeful that you can offer him the appropriate care to assist him in managing this condition.

He was recently admitted to the hospital with increasing shortness of breath over several months on a background of investigations for Parkinson's disease. He was diagnosed with recurrent aspirations and recovered well. Moreover, while an inpatient, he experienced a fall and injured his back, and an XR lumbar spine showed a stable L1 anterior wedge fracture that was treated conservatively with analgesia and therapy.\n\nHowever, over the next few weeks, Mr. Alderman experienced increasing difficulty opening his bowels and passing urine (although voiding symptoms were usual for him due to BPH). A post-void bladder scan showed only 260ml. He continued to mobilize normally, and no concerns regarding weakness were raised. A PR exam showed reduced but intact sensation and normal tone, but with reduced ability to squeeze. An MRI spine was requested on 8-5-18 and showed some retropulsion of bony fragments into the anterior one-third of the spinal canal. However, CSF signal remained around the conus and surrounding nerve roots.\n\nTherefore, we would appreciate your expert input regarding the management of this gentleman.

He is well known to Dr. Page, Dr. Burn, and the Dorset epilepsy team. He is currently on anti-epileptic medication including epilim chrono, tegnetol retard, diazepam, and phenobarbital. He has a vagal nerve stimulator in situ.\n\nSince he has been on a ward, he has had 2 episodes of reduced responsiveness, only responding to voice, which have spontaneously resolved. The impression is that these are seizures in a postictal state. Therefore, we would be grateful if you could review this gentleman.\n\nThank you for your assistance in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

He experienced a tonic-clonic seizure for around one minute without any injury or tongue biting. He was drowsy after that and experienced further partial seizures with lip smacking and left-arm shaking in ED three times and vomited once. His GCS was 14, and he had a further partial seizure on post-take ward rounds in front of the team. Currently, the patient is slow in speech and thought, and he has very little memory of that day's events.\n\nThe patient's usual medications include Lamotrigine 200mg BD, and he has been started on phenytoin loading since admission. Although he usually has 24/7 carers to watch for seizures, in view of his unusual history, we have attempted to get more information from both the patient and the carer. However, his carer is new, and we have little information from them.\n\nTherefore, I believe it would be best to refer him to a neurology specialist for further evaluation and management.\n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Doctor\u2019s name and signature] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

The patient presented to us on July 14, 2016, with two episodes of collapse and unconsciousness that lasted for 30 minutes, without any warning signs. Their pulse was regular, and their neurology examination and bloods were unremarkable. The pacemaker check showed no arrhythmias and sinus rhythm at 65 bpm. During their admission, they had another unresponsive episode, which lasted for five minutes. They maintained their own airway and did not show any evidence of seizure activity. The patient was actively resisting NP airway, had lower limb shaking, and scored 3-15 GCS. After five minutes, they proceeded to have a normal conversation with their husband.
