The patient was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, site not specified and has been treated with gentamicin + IVI since admission. We have seen an improvement in the patient's condition and her fever has subsided.\n\nThe patient has a background of Parkinson's disease and psychotic depression and was previously on Madopar before being switched to Sinemet 187.5mg TDS due to associated weight loss and diarrhea. The patient was last reviewed by you, and you believed there had been some improvement since reducing her aripiprazole, but you did not feel an increase in Sinemet would be helpful.\n\nDuring her current admission, the patient has been withdrawn and difficult to communicate with, making it challenging to assess her motor function. A review by the liaison psychiatry noted that the patient is extremely blunted in affect secondary to psychotic depression with delirium. However, once the patient received her usual aripiprazole over the weekend, she seemed less withdrawn.\n\nThe PD nurse, Lynette, suggested that a review by you while the patient is an inpatient would be appropriate.

His wife, who is a surgical SRN, provided collateral history. Mr. XXXX reports feeling well now but has no recall of events after experiencing right chest wall pain and feeling clammy while he was passing urine at 07.00. He reports no chest pain or dyspnoea. \n\nUpon examination, his wife reported that he was lying on the floor with limbs outstretched and his eyes open but moving all four limbs in a jerky manner, suggestive of tonic-clonic activity. There was no response to voice, but he self-terminated after approximately 30 seconds. He experienced a transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) and showed no disorientation after the event. There was no tongue biting or urinary incontinence, but he did report having a dull parietal-occipital headache. \n\nWe are unsure whether this event constitutes seizure activity, and we would appreciate your assistance with diagnostic procedures.

Power in the left leg is significantly decreased, and there is shooting pain on passive left ankle flexion and leg raise. Eye movements are normal, and the CN examination is normal.\n\nWe have reassured the patient that a structural cause for weakness and numbness has been excluded with the normal MRI scans and that this may be a functional problem secondary to her previous fall.

He was asymptomatic and did not remember the events.\n\nHe has a history of left MCA aneurysm and a small old right parietal infarction noted during a CT brain scan, which showed no changes apart from a slight increase in calcification. Magnesium was replaced, and Omeprazole was changed to Ranitidine, after which he returned to his normal state and was discharged.\n\nHowever, since then, his family reports that he has become increasingly disoriented, with visual hallucinations and headaches. He was brought back to the hospital after becoming restless and aggressive, with complaints of dysuria and no history of fever, speech-visual disturbance, and focal weakness in extremities. On admission, he was clearly disorientated in time, place, and person, paranoid, and suffering from auditory and visual hallucinations. He lacked capacity and became increasingly aggressive, requiring restraint and IM Haloperidol 2.5mg, which had little effect.\n\nHe was then brought to the ICU, where he was ventilated to allow for a repeat CT brain and lumbar puncture, which I suspect could be due to encephalitis.\n\nIn summary, I respectfully request your assistance in advising on further investigations and management of this patient.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

She also reported a 2-3-7 history of reduced sensation in both feet and pain in both groins. Furthermore, she has longstanding urinary incontinence, and she reported incomplete bowel emptying.

Mrs. Smith has been experiencing unusual symptoms that suggest a neurological cause, and I believe that as a neurologist, you will be better placed to evaluate and manage her condition.\n\nMrs. Smith was admitted with epileptic episodes, which were marked by agitation, distress, aggression, and suicidal ideation. Her speech during these episodes was rambling and nonsensical, and she tended to be disoriented. She would be restrained for two hours, after which she would develop a severe headache and feel very drowsy. Additionally, she has developed psychotic symptoms, mostly delusions that people are trying to kill her.\n\nOver the last few months, Mrs. Smith has also developed migrainous-like symptoms that involve photophobia, visual changes, and seeing zig-zag lines. The episodes last for about 20 minutes, and she has no headache during this time. However, they are occurring more frequently, and she was recently experiencing them several times a day.\n\nMrs. Shaw has no past history of mental health problems, while her family has no history of psychiatric illness or dementia. After evaluation, I believe that her symptoms are more likely neurological than psychiatric. The brief events before admission could have had a migrainous aetiology, or they could be epileptiform. The more recent severe agitation, disorientation, and aggression may be partial seizure activity, which leaves her disoriented and with delusional beliefs that people are trying to kill her.\n\nTherefore, I am requesting that you review Mrs. Shaw's case and investigate her condition further to establish an accurate diagnosis and provide the appropriate treatment.

The patient was initially referred to you for an inpatient review but is now keen to get home for Christmas after showing improved symptoms.\n\nCurrently, the patient's symptoms include bilateral lower limb weakness and left upper arm weakness. The patient has a history of back pain and was found to have a small cervical syrinx in 2011, following a fall down the stairs, leaving them unable to move their lower limbs. The patient underwent several years of rehabilitation and has only been mobilizing independently for one year (able to use stairs). On 19-12-15, the patient presented with an inability to lift their left arm and lower limbs after falling asleep in a chair. The patient initially reported urinary incontinence, which is now resolved. There are no bowel symptoms. \n\nDuring a clinical examination, the patient showed normal tone in all limbs, apart from the left hand held in flexion and resistant to movement - suggestive of longstanding spasticity (which the patient reports as new). Power 5-5 in the right arm but left arm 1-5 power, and bilateral lower limbs 0-5 - completely flaccid. Reflexes were normal throughout, and there was no clonus.\n\nThe patient has an unclear diagnosis from neurology, and it has been noted that this may have an underlying psychological aspect to their condition, given their history and unclear neurology. It would be helpful to receive your clarification that there is not an underlying condition to the patient's presentation. No MRI was taken on this admission as it was felt that a repeat MRI would not be necessary, given the likely functional nature of the patient's symptoms.\n\nThank you for your attention to this case, and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,\n\n<Your name and designation>\n\n Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

The patient, a 76-year-old gentleman, was admitted to our hospital on 14-04-18 with onset of right-sided neck pain, and the pain progressed to his entire neck, and then severe pain at the base of his skull. The patient was febrile at 38.4, with raised C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (which rose to 249), and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15-15. No confusion was noted todate, no seizures were observed, and no focal neurology was found. His CT and MRI brain scans were normal, whereby the MRI C-spine only showed spondylitic changes with no evidence of infective discs, and no compressive myelopathy or cord compression. The vasculitic screen was also normal, and the Rheumatology team was satisfied that no systemic process was accounting for his presentation. \n\nOn 15-04-18, a lumbar puncture (LP) was performed on this patient; it was traumatic, with the first bottle being blood-stained, showing the CSF protein level as 1.74, and the cell count being WBC (Bottle 1) <1 X 10^6-L RBC (Bottle 1) 722 X 10^6-L WBC (Bottle 3) <1 X 10^6-L RBC (Bottle 3) 35 X 10^6-L.

The CSF has been sent for viral screen. \n\nThe patient was commenced on antibiotics for sepsis of unknown origin, although viral meningitis has not been excluded yet. His condition has improved since he was on antibiotics, and since stopping the same on 20-04-18. In light of the raised CSF protein, we would appreciate it if you could advise us on whether to perform further investigations, and if so, which ones; and whether the traumatic nature of the LP, viral meningitis, or any other underlying condition is responsible for the elevated CSF protein.  \n\nWe would be grateful for your expertise in managing this case, and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nSincerely, \n\n[Your Name and Designation]\n Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

We would like to know whether further management is required before he is transferred to the Stroke Rehab Unit at Southampton Hospital. \n\nMr. XXXX was admitted to our hospital after an overdose of 300mg Oramorph, which caused him to become unconscious. It was discovered that he had aspiration pneumonia, which we treated with IV Tazocin. He was intubated and ventilated to ensure airway protection and ventilatory assistance. During his stay with us, we noticed evolving multi-organ failure suggesting a significant hypoxic episode. The CT scan revealed bilateral lacunar infarcts, while the EEG showed diffuse hypoxic brain injury.\n\nRemarkably, Mr. XXXX made a considerable recovery, although he has little recollection of the events leading up to the overdose. He has been restless ever since, and we have noticed a marked deterioration in his balance. He is still disorientated, with poor insight and memory, and he is perseverating. Although he is responsive and able to name things, he is unable to write and can only manage two-stage commands. He is aware that he has had a stroke, and occasional Haloperidol is needed overnight for agitation. \n\nMr. XXXX is eating and drinking and has received input from our Therapy team. He has residual right arm and left weakness (4-5) with mild right facial droop and a right arm pronator drift. His left-hand side has normal power, and he has normal sensation in all his limbs.\n\nDue to his reduced eGFR and AKI, a Renal USS has been requested and will be done shortly. We are monitoring his renal function closely. Mr. XXXX has been reviewed by Dr. Burn, Acquired Brain Injury, and Dr. Ragab, Stroke Consultant, who both agree that he is medically stable for transfer. \n\nMr. XXXX is keen to go back to Southampton, where he lives. Dr. Zeun, Stroke Reg, has accepted the patient and has agreed to his transfer.

She was found on the floor with a brief history of aggression and hallucinations. She has had recurrent episodes of reduced cognition-consciousness, but a review of her previous investigations shows no evidence of any abnormality. She has been treated with lamotrigine and undergone MRI, which showed no significant change except for small vessel disease. Her condition has deteriorated, and she has become nonverbal with recurrent vacant episodes lasting hours. Although an EEG performed during one of these episodes was reported as entirely normal, there remains an element of clinical doubt, and we are not fully convinced of our working diagnosis. She has been treated as a delirium with limited improvement. Dr. Perry has requested your opinion on this matter to ensure that we are not missing something potentially reversible.

He has a previous medical history of left parietal abnormality as well as epilepsy, for which he is taking sodium valproate. Given the history of recurrent falls and the persistence of the left parietal lesion, I am requesting a neurology review to see if there is an underlying cause contributing to these symptoms. Cardiology review has also been requested due to the patient's history of AF and slightly raised trop.

Further examination showed him to be febrile with a temperature of 38.4 and raised CRP that rose to 249. Although he had no confusion, seizures, or focal neurology, his MRI brain scan and CT scan were both normal. He also had spondylitic changes with no evidence of infective discs or compressive myelopathy or cord compression. The vasculitic screen returned normal, and the Rheumatology team was satisfied that there was no systemic process accounting for his presentation.\n\nLP was performed on 15-04-18, which was traumatic, with the first bottle being bloodstained. CSF protein level was measured to be 1.74, and there were no bacterial growths on gram staining. The SCF has been sent for a viral screen. [Patient Name] was commenced on antibiotics for sepsis of unknown origin, and since that day, he had been showing improvement.\n\nGiven the raised CSF protein on the LP, we would like to know if this is due to the traumatic nature of the LP, viral meningitis, or if further investigations are required.

The patient's background history reveals a traumatic fall down 15 steps and hit head, followed by recovery. However, 12 days ago, left leg pain developed along with shooting pain from the lower back down to the foot. Over 1-52, she developed left leg weakness up to the point where she had to drag it along and had 2 falls. Later, she developed weakness and numbness in the left arm, although she was still able to move the arm. Around 3-7 days ago, she suffered a complete loss of vision in the left eye, which has since returned to blurred vision.\n\nThe patient attended RBH and underwent normal MRI brain and whole spine and a normal eye examination. However, the patient self-discharged before a neuro review as there were problems with the ward staff. Following the episode, she presented to Poole with left-leg weakness. On examination today, the patient showed patchy decreased sensation in the left side of the face, left hand, and minimal decreased sensation in the left forearm. There was also decreased power 2-5 in the left leg and shooting pain ++ on passive left ankle flexion and leg raise. CN examination was normal.\n\nWe have reassured the patient that a structural cause of weakness and numbness has been excluded with the normal MRI scans, and we suspect that this may be a functional problem caused by her previous fall. In light of the symptoms, we have initiated treatment with gabapentin for nerve-type pain management and have asked physio to review the patient. However, we would like your opinion on whether this is functional weakness or if further investigations and treatment are necessary.\n\nThank you for your time and your assistance in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

Based on the exams, we suspect an appearance of MS plaques or vascular abnormality, possibly on a background of small vessel disease.\n\nIn our recent discussion with the neurosurgical registrar at Southampton, the recommendation was to start the patient on anti-convulsant treatment.
