The patient, Mrs. Y, presented with bilateral lower limb weakness and left upper arm weakness. She has a long history of back pain and had a small cervical syrinx found when she presented in 2011 following a fall down stairs. She underwent several years of rehabilitation and has been mobilising independently for one year now.\n\nShe presented on 19-12-15 with weakness in her left upper limb and complete flaccidity in her bilateral lower limbs. Initially, she reported urinary incontinence, but this has since resolved. On clinical examination, there was normal tone in all limbs apart from the left hand, which was held in flexion and resistant to movement, suggestive of longstanding spasticity (patient reports as new). Her power was 5-5 in her right arm and 1-5 power in her left arm. Bilateral lower limbs were 0-5 - completely flaccid. Reflexes were normal throughout. We feel that, given her unclear diagnosis from neurology and unclear history, this may have an underlying psychological aspect to her condition.\n\nWe believe that further evaluation and management are necessary and would welcome your clarification and assistance in this matter. She has not had an MRI on this admission, as it is felt that this is most likely functional and a repeat MRI would feed into this.\n\nThank you for considering this request.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. X Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

Initially, the patient was admitted as an inpatient, but as they have shown evidence of improvement and are eager to return home for Christmas, an outpatient review is now appropriate.\n\nThe patient presents with bilateral lower limb weakness and left upper arm weakness, consistent with a long history of back pain. In 2011, a small cervical syrinx was found following a fall down stairs, which left the patient unable to move their lower limbs. They underwent several years of rehabilitation and have only been mobilizing independently for one year (able to use stairs). On 19-12-15, the patient presented again after falling asleep in a chair and waking up being unable to move her left arm and both lower limbs, with initial urinary incontinence, now resolved. On clinical examination, the patient has normal tone in all limbs except for the left hand, which is held in flexion and resistant to movement, suggestive of longstanding spasticity. There is 5-5 power in the right arm, 1-5 power in the left arm, and bilateral lower limb 0-5 - completely flaccid. Reflexes are normal throughout. \n\nThe patient has an unclear diagnosis from neurology, and given their history and unclear neurology, there may be an underlying psychological aspect to their presentation. We would welcome your clarification that there is not an underlying condition to her presentation. The patient has not had an MRI on this admission as it was felt that, as this is most likely functional, a repeat MRI would feed into this.\n\nThank you for your continued support in treating our patients.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[Your Name and Title] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

This gentleman experienced a chronic back pain flare-up and was referred to the orthopaedic surgeon, Mr Hilton. Mr Hilton tentatively diagnosed him with the L5-S1 discectomy, with plans for L4-5 discectomy in six months. Despite these measures, the patient reports ongoing back pain, with right leg pain, weakness, and loss of sensation. Unfortunately, a repeat MRI has revealed no evidence of disc prolapse or nerve root compression. On examination, there is reduced power of the right lower limb, with normal reflexes bilaterally and loss of sensation on the right side. The patient's left lower limb has normal sensation and 4-5 power. The spinal surgeons recommend waiting for surgery as planned, with no acute indications for surgery at present.

The patient, [Patient Name], was admitted to our facility after a fall with loss of consciousness. It is thought likely that the incident was secondary to postural hypotension, as the patient reports experiencing two falls per day. While admitted, we found that the patient's inflammatory markers were raised but ultimately settled after being treated for aspiration pneumonia.\n\nThe patient usually lives fairly independently at home and does not require a package of care. However, they do have a past medical history of AF and CVA 2017 involving two tiny sites of hemorrhage in the right cerebellar hemisphere and corpus callosum, as well as thalassemia trait and portal hypertension.\n\nPrior to admission, the patient experienced poor oral intake, leading to associated weight loss on the background of a low BMI. We reviewed the patient's condition with our speech and language therapy team and found that they have severe oropharyngeal dysphagia. They have been advised for NBM and NG feed due to the notable deterioration that is perceived to be significantly worse than during previous admissions.\n\nDuring the course of our assessment, we noted that the patient experienced fatigability. Further tests, including CT head and MRI for possible further cerebrovascular events, demonstrated no evidence of infarct or hemorrhage, although it did reveal small vessel disease (including the pons). The patient's speech is of a nasal quality, with ataxic dysarthria. We plan to conduct videofluoroscopy in the upcoming days and to test for AChR antibodies.\n\nWe would be grateful for your opinion as to whether her symptoms could be explained by a previous stroke with small vessel disease of the brainstem or an alternative aetiology like myasthenia or bulbar palsy.\n\nThank you for your assistance in providing care to this patient.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your name and title] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

She reports a feeling of lightheadedness with subsequent loss of consciousness. Often the syncope is associated with emotional stress, strong smells or standing for a prolonged period of time. She has noticed that when she is able to sit down or lie down when she experiences the lightheadedness, it prevents the syncope episode from occurring. She denies chest pain or palpitations. Dear Dr. Patel, I am referring this patient to you for a cardiology consultation.

She was admitted to our hospital due to unusual epileptic episodes that sometimes lead to suicidal attempts. The episodes involve agitation, distress, and aggression, and her speech becomes rambling and nonsensical. Her episodes last for about two hours and require restraint while they are occurring. She experiences \"blinding headaches\" and drowsiness after the episodes end. She also recently developed delusions that her family and other people are attempting to kill her. These episodes have been coming on with increasing frequency.\n\nFurther, this unfortunate patient recently developed some strange episodes that resemble migraines, such as photophobia and visual changes with zig-zag lines. These episodes have been coming on with increased frequency and were happening several times per day in the lead-up to her admission. She has no history of mental health problems, and there is no family history of psychiatric illness or dementia.\n\nOur psychiatry liaison believes that she may be suffering from a neurological condition rather than a psychiatric one.

The first was witnessed by pub staff who described it as a tonic-clonic seizure lasting for 1-2 minutes. He was post-ictal upon arrival to the hospital. A further seizure lasting 2 minutes occurred in the ambulance. Upon arrival to the Emergency Department (ED), he had one further seizure and also experienced vomiting. Mr. X also reported an episode of self-terminating seizure the night before. There was no history of head injury, but a nose injury was sustained during the first one. His Glasgow Coma Score was 15 on arrival. Mr. X had poor recollection of events and was disoriented in time. He claims to have experienced a seizure one year ago. The possibility of alcohol-dependency was considered, as Mr. X was consuming approximately three beers per day, however, this has been noted as being under the daily recommended limit. He has started a reducing regime of chlordiazepoxide and pabrinex. It is recommended that Mr. X be referred to the appropriate specialist for further evaluation and management to identify the underlying cause of his seizures.

The patient was admitted to our hospital with progressive leg weakness and numbness that has been ongoing for six months, and an acute deterioration within the past two weeks. \n\nHe had previously been evaluated by a rheumatologist one month ago, and his MRI from June 15th revealed L2-3 stenosis with bunching of cauda equina.

He has already had a lumbar puncture that showed no malignant cells, no bacterial growth, but a protein level of 0.65. We are still waiting for the results of the oligoclonal bands test. \n\nGiven his condition, I believe Mr. [Patient's name] would benefit from the expertise of a neurologist who can help create a comprehensive treatment plan for his newly diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis. \n\nThank you for your consideration. \n\nSincerely, \n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

Mr. Saunders is a 40-year-old gentleman who has been experiencing episodes of waking up on the floor with associated tongue biting since February 2015. These episodes initially occurred at night time but now also happen throughout the day. Mr. Saunders has been experiencing these episodes every couple of weeks. \n\nOn one occasion, the attack was witnessed by his cousin in which he was shaking all 4 limbs, lasting for approximately 10 minutes. Mr Saunders was admitted on the 17th May due to a further 'attack' at work. His wife reported that he was dizzy and then suddenly slumped back, his eyes rolled back and started to make heavy breathing noises. Then he slumped to lying down position, arms became rigid and contacted up to chest but no limb tremour, and incontinent of urine. He does not remember the attack but recalls feeling disorientated for 1 hour post-event, biting his tongue and lacerating his right eye. He also reports to have experienced a similar episode at work 3 weeks ago. \n\nOn a daily basis, Mr. Saunders experiences sensations of shaking and jerking which begins in his left leg and travels to the rest of his body. They can sometimes last all day and sometimes, he can control them. Mr. Saunders denies any drug or alcohol abuse. Mr. Saunders is due a neurology clinic review in July but due to the recurrent episodes, I would be very much grateful for your review and advice on whether to start anticonvulsant therapy.\n\nThank you for your assistance in managing my patient.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your name and designation] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

She presented to me initially on Friday with a headache on the right side of her head. Shortly after, she experienced a bizarre absence episode while speaking with a friend over the phone. According to the friend, she suddenly started slurring her words, dropped her wine and hung up. On Saturday and Sunday, she reported feeling nauseated and vomited a few times. \n\nOn Monday, the situation escalated as she suffered another long absence episode, which lasted 45 minutes. She spilled hot tea on herself during this episode. She attempted to go to work the next day but felt unsteady and nauseous the entire time. This led to her vomiting in the car and driving back home. Her condition remained the same on Tuesday, and she felt like she was in a dream while driving to work. This caused her to swerve on the road, and she was pulled over by another driver who called an ambulance. She has no recollection of the ambulance ride.\n\nShe denies any chest pain, SOB, abdo pain, coryzal symptoms, visual disturbance, weight loss, urinary symptoms, changes in bowel habit, limb weakness, loss of sensation, falls, or foreign travel in the last 1-12.

She had coryzal symptoms for two weeks before her admission, which was prefaced by four episodes of vomiting and a few cases of diarrhea. [Patient Name] eventually developed neck pain and a headache, which were later followed by bilateral leg weakness that registered a 4-5 power level, accompanied by reduced reflexes and sensation that began to spread upward. The current level of affectedness is located at T7. We consulted with Dr. Massey on Friday, who recommended a five-day course of IVIG for possible Guillain-Barre Syndrome that [Patient Name] has been receiving and is slated to complete today. An LP revealed increased protein levels, and an MRI of her lumbar spine showed multilevel lumbar posterior disc bulges, which moderately impacted nerve performance. An MRI of her thoracic-cervical spine subsequently discovered marginal disc space narrowing at C4-C5 and C5-C6, and there was a note regarding right posterolateral uncovertebral bars at C4-C5 and C5-C6, which has led to moderate narrowing of the right exiting foramen, potentially causing irritation to the exiting right C5 and right C6 nerve roots.

The CT and MRI scans showed no significant abnormal findings, except for some spondylitic changes in the cervical spine. \n\nOne of the abnormalities we noted on the LP was a raised CSF protein level of 1.74, which we believe could be an indication of viral meningitis. Additionally, we have not yet received the results of the viral screen, so we are seeking your advice on whether further investigations are necessary, or if the raised CSF protein could be explained by the traumatic nature of the LP.\n\nIt is important to note that the patient has been improving since being on antibiotics, and there have been no further complications or setbacks. \n\nThank you for your time and for considering this case.

The patient is a 36-year-old gentleman who was admitted to our hospital on 11th October 2018 with limb jerking. His past medical history includes epilepsy for the last two years, with the last seizure occurring 6-12 months ago. The patient was diagnosed with idiopathic tonic-clonic epilepsy and fibromyalgia. He has also undergone left knee meniscal repair.\n\nAfter admission, the patient had a thorough investigation that revealed normal CT and MRI head scans. An EEG was also normal, with no evidence of an epileptic basis for jerks. However, LP results are still pending and expected to be available at the time of neurology review. \n\nAs there has been no tonic-clonic seizure for the last 6-12 months, the patient reported 3-7 episodes of trunk-limb jerking without a loss of consciousness. The patient also experienced vomiting 4 times, slight headache, and poor sleep. The fingers started tingling and getting numb right before the onset of seizures.\n\nWith this referral letter, I would like to request you to review the patient and guide us in the appropriate management of the condition.\n\nKind regards,\nDr Prescott Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

She was previously seen by Dr. Burns in 2007 for cervical myelitis and osteoporosis. She reports having MS, although we are uncertain who gave her this diagnosis. She also has numerous neurological issues, including bilateral subjective paraesthesia in the lower limbs, urinary incontinence, and diffuse upper limb weakness. She is currently wheelchair bound due to foot drop and balance problems, but is unable to specify what these problems may be. \n\nShe also experienced a worsening of her function following a Dynamic Hip screw insertion in October 2014, and has had bilateral paraesthesia since then. The screw was subsequently noted to have eroded through the femoral head, and we are in the process of speaking to an orthopedic specialist to get this addressed. We admitted her with a possible UTI which was treated by her GP, and both MSU and blood cultures have been negative. A collateral history from her son is one of slowly worsening function. We would appreciate your expert opinion regarding her neurological symptoms, as we are unsure if this is a progression of her cervical myelitis or a new presentation. Would further imaging be diagnostically helpful and would she benefit from regular follow up with a neurologist?\n\nYour assistance in managing her symptoms would be greatly appreciated.

She is a [age] year old with a history of neutropenic sepsis and was recently admitted to Durlston Hospital with worsening headaches, vomiting and photophobia. Her current treatment includes IV Meropenem, which was initiated upon admission.\n\nTwo weeks ago, she suffered a similar episode that resolved after a few days. An MRI at this time revealed bilateral white matter signals, which was initially thought to be due to a viral infection of the brain (she has previously had HSV encephalitis), but the lumbar puncture performed and sent for bacterial and viral screen revealed negative results. In addition, there were no detected results for JC virus, hepatitis, CMV, EBV, or Herpes screens. Discussion with UCLH and neurology revealed that the images and her clinical symptoms-signs were more in keeping with methotrexate encephalopathy, which she had been experiencing from high doses as part of her chemotherapy regime.\n\nAn MRI performed just this morning indicated that there are no overt signs of meningitis and suggested that there was no change to the abnormal white matter signal seen on previous MRIs. Given her representation and complex background, we are keen to perform a further lumbar puncture to ascertain any cause as to why these have re-occurred. We would be grateful for your input in regards to any further investigations you may think necessary (including the LP) and if there are any other medications you might suggest to help manage the pain (current analgesia listed in the history below).\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

The patient, a gentleman, was admitted to our facility on the 23rd of August with episodes of seizures, weakness in his right arm, speech problems, and problems with his vision on his right eye.\n\nDuring his stay, his seizures have become more frequent, local in nature, and are associated with absence affecting the right hand-side. The seizures are not tonic-clonic in nature and he experienced 14 seizures on the 25th of August and has had 11 today. They last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, being the longest recorded. Today, during a seizure both his right arm and right leg twitched, and he was treated with 1mg of lorazepam. \n\nUpon examination, it was found that he has no pronater drift, but he does have slight right-sided weakness in proximal muscle groups and facial muscles. Due to these concerns, we feel it would be best for him to be assessed at your clinic for further management and treatment.

The patient has a history of chronic low back pain that started two years ago after he sustained a lumbar injury while lifting heavy boxes. Over the past few weeks, the patient has developed bilateral numbness and tingling in his lower limbs, as well as problems with bowel and bladder function. The patient had an MRI of his lumbar spine, which revealed a broad-based disc bulge at the level of L4-L5 with effacement of the epidural fat anteriorly. We are currently awaiting a referral to an orthopaedic surgeon for further evaluation and management. However, given the patient's worsening symptoms, we are concerned that there may be some underlying neurological compromise that requires urgent attention.

Mrs. Shaw is an 88-year-old woman who has been experiencing epileptic episodes. These episodes result in agitation, distress, and aggression. She has had several bouts of suicidal feelings and has delusions that her family and other people are trying to kill her. She has also developed a severe headache followed by drowsiness after each episode.\n\nShe has a migraine-like condition in which she feels something unpleasant coming on, has photophobia, and sees visual changes similar to zig-zag lines surrounding her with both eyes. There is no association with headache or mental health history. There is no family history of psychiatric illness or dementia.\n\nPsychiatry liaison has assessed her and decided that it is possible that the brief events she has experienced before admission had migrainous aetiology, but this also could have been epileptiform. The more severe episodes of agitation, rambling speech, and aggression always ending with a severe headache followed by drowsiness may be related to partial seizure activity, which might account for the development of delusional beliefs and associated distress.\n\nConsidering the above, further investigations and management of her neurological condition are required.

The patient was admitted via their GP on 23-8-15 with a severe right frontal headache. They have had previous sinus surgery back in 2007 in their right maxillary sinus, but they have not had any significant problems with their sinuses since then. The patient describes their main complaint as being a severe headache, pain coming from both sides of their jaw. The pain is a constant dull ache with intermittent sharp stabbing pains above the right eye. There are no visual symptoms, only some mild photophobia that they find mildly uncomfortable. There is no meningism. The patient has a normal neurological and cranial nerve examination, and their blood test results are all unremarkable except for a significantly raised CRP (CRP-223). We are awaiting the ESR result.\n\nInitially treated as sinusitis, the patient's pain did not improve, and so we arranged for a CT which showed no evidence of sinusitis, no other abnormalities, and normal brain parenchyma. The patient was also reviewed by maxfax, who reviewed the dental side and was happy there was no dental cause for the pain. \n\nGiven that the patient still has a significant amount of headache, and we have still not found any definitive cause, we would be grateful for your assessment of them. Your expertise in headache management could help us to find the cause of the headache and assist us in developing an effective treatment plan for the patient.\n\nThank you for your time and attention.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

However, the Alcohol Clinical Treatment Services (ACTS) team does not believe he is alcohol dependent as he only consumes three beers per day. We recommend further evaluation and management by a specialist, including appropriate investigations and a review of his medication regimen. We appreciate the prompt management and care of our patient and look forward to your expert guidance on his ongoing evaluation and care.

There is no evidence of infection. She presented similarly in December 2015 and spent a two-month admission on Portland Ward for rehab.\n\nWe would be grateful for a neurology opinion of this lady, with review of further investigations and management, and whether transfer to Portland ward for neuro rehab might be of some benefit.\n\nThank you very much for considering our referral.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

This 74-year-old gentleman came to us with right-sided facial weakness and shingles, along with a history of pain over the right opthalmic distribution for five weeks. The patient also reported having a rash four weeks ago that was treated as shingles by the GP, who prescribed oral aciclovir and amitriptyline along with pregabalin for analgesia.\n\nOn further examination, the patient had right-sided facial weakness and slurred speech. Although he claimed to have had these symptoms right from the start, his son and daughter-in-law felt that these were new symptoms. It is pertinent to note that the patient is known to have thalamic infarct, as revealed by his recent CT and MRI scans. There were no signs of new infarct in both reports. However, the MRI also revealed his history of neurofibromatosis type 1, and we have booked an outpatient MRI IAM for him.\n\nConsidering the patient's complex clinical history, we would greatly appreciate your advice regarding the best management plan for him from here. We have now discharged this gentleman as he remains medically fit before the bank holiday weekend.

Upon admission, he was agitated with confused speech and was treated for encephalitis. \n\nHe was transferred to the ICU on the 21st of January after his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) dropped further, and he was unable to maintain his airway. He was subsequently intubated and started on leviteracetam. Due to suspicion of subclinical seizures, he was loaded on phenytoin, and tazocin was started. Imaging with CT and MRI revealed no clear cause for these symptoms.\n\nOn the 30th of January, Dr. Page felt that he likely had a metabolic encephalopathy. The elderly care consultants later reviewed him on the ICU and felt that he had a grave outcome. He was then transferred from the ITU to a medical ward where he became chesty, had a raised temperature, and was treated briefly for ventilator-acquired pneumonia before his condition deteriorated further. It was then decided to palliate him.\n\nOver the past week, he has become more alert and started speaking, and after discussing with his children, it was decided to stop palliative care.

He presented with a history of seizure and confusion that might be a side effect of medication.\n\nMr. Y had a tonic-clonic seizure following the initiation of omeprazole 40mg QDS when he was admitted to the hospital. A CT brain was performed and showed no change in the size of the left MCA aneurysm, with a slight increase in calcification. He had no history of previous seizure. His magnesium was replaced via IV, and the omeprazole was changed to ranitidine. He returned to normal, and he was discharged. However, his family noticed a progressive confusion status with visual hallucinations.\n\nHe was admitted again to the hospital, complaining of visual hallucinations, headache, and dysuria, with no history of fever. He was experiencing progressively aggressive behavior and confusion throughout the day. He absconded from the hospital, extremely unsteady on his feet, and had to be brought back by a passing paramedic. He was seen by the psychiatric team, who found him to be floridly psychotic, disorientated in time, place, and person, collectively paranoid, and lacking clear capacity. The patient was given IM haloperidol, which had little effect. Therefore, we believe further investigation is needed, including a repeat CT Brain and Lumbar puncture searching for potential encephalitis cases.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you could advise on further investigations and management of this patient as soon as possible.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Your Name and Signature] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

The patient presented to our hospital with a frontal headache that gradually developed into a throbbing sensation, accompanied by vomiting, photophobia, and neck stiffness. She has also experienced blurred vision and coordination difficulties. The patient has a VP shunt in situ since the age of 3 due to meningitis with hydrocephalus, as well as a history of non-epileptic seizures and migraines.\n\nUpon examination, her GCS is 15, and there is no focal neurology of concern. PEARL is present, and no papilloedema is detected. However, the patient cannot put her chin to her chest due to neck stiffness. Kernig's test is negative, and there is no visible rash. A CT scan revealed that the brain looked normal with a VP shunt in situ and somewhat slitlike ventricles, which we suspect may be due to over-correction. We discussed this case with the neurosurgery team at SGH and they have recommended a shunt series xray, as well as an opinion from your team regarding a possible low-pressure headache or migraine.\n\nThank you for your assistance in this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

I would like to refer to you our 83-year-old patient who was diagnosed with J18.9 - Pneumonia, unspecified organism. He was previously independent and living alone until he was admitted to the hospital on 19-1-18. He was found collapsed in his bathroom, with agitated behavior and confused speech. Upon admission, he was diagnosed with encephalitis and was treated accordingly until his GCS dropped further. He was intubated and started on leviteracetam due to subclinical seizures that were detected. He was also loaded on phenytoin and tazocin as a precautionary measure. CT and MRI imaging did not reveal any clear reason for his condition. After being reviewed by our consultants, it was concluded that he most likely had a metabolic encephalopathy. Despite everything that was done to stabilize him, his condition continued to deteriorate, and it was decided to palliate him. However, he started to regain consciousness and become more responsive after a week, and therapy sessions were started with our ward therapists. Given the previous independence of our patient, we believe he would benefit greatly from your expertise.

Ms Gillard reported that she had been mobilising well with her frame following her right hip replacement 5 weeks ago. However, 4 days ago, she dozed off for a short period in a chair and woke up with her right lower limb feeling weak. There is no pain and no sensory symptoms. On clinical examination, the right lower limb is globally weak, and the right knee and ankle jerks are brisk. Nerve conduction studies and needle EMG have shown no abnormalities to account for her symptoms. As diagnostic abnormalities may not emerge for 2-3 weeks following nerve injury, we are requesting for repeat study in 10 to 14 days. However, the history of sudden onset of symptoms, preserved (brisk) right knee and ankle jerks in the presence of very dense limb weakness suggest this may turn out to be upper motor neuron pathology.\n\nWe greatly appreciate your assistance in providing the necessary care and treatment for Ms Gillard.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

The patient was admitted to our hospital on 1-9-15 following a tonic-clonic seizure. The seizure was thought to be secondary to a low magnesium after starting Omeprazole 40mg QDS. The patient did not remember the events and had no prodromal symptoms. A CT Brain was performed which showed no change in the size of the left MCA aneurysm, apart from a slight increase in calcification. Magnesium was replaced IV, and omeprazole changed to ranitidine. The patient returned back to normal and was therefore discharged.\n\nSince being discharged, the patient's family has noticed him becoming increasingly confused with reports of visual hallucinations. He became more restless and aggressive so was brought to the ED. On admission, he reported having visual hallucinations since discharge associated with a headache. There was no history of fever. He had no speech-visual disturbance, no focal weakness in extremities. Throughout the day he became increasingly confused and agitated. He absconded from the hospital, very unsteady, unsafe on feet, aggressive, and difficult to manage. The patient was reviewed by the psychiatric team who found him to be floridly psychotic, disorientated in time, place, and person, as well as paranoid (believing staff wanted to harm him). He also appeared to be experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations. He was given IM haloperidol initially, but this had little effect so at MET Call was put out. On arrival, the patient was needing a lot of encouragement and restraint to keep him in his room, and was grabbing and his head and rolling around. He was therefore given IV haloperidol and his friend was then able to calm him somewhat. He was then brought up to ITU where he was Intubated and Ventilated to allow for a repeat CT Brain and Lumbar puncture.

She reports having MS but we are unable to confirm whether she was diagnosed with this condition by a healthcare professional.\n\nMrs. XXXX presents with numerous neurological issues, including bilateral subjective paraesthesia in the lower limbs, urinary incontinence, and diffuse upper limb weakness.

The screw has subsequently been noted to have eroded through the femoral head and we are working with orthopaedics regarding getting this addressed.\n\nShe was admitted with a possible UTI which was treated by her GP, and both MSU and blood cultures have been negative. A collateral history from her son indicates slowly worsening function. We are unsure if this is a progression of her cervical myelitis or a new presentation of her neurological symptoms.\n\nWe would greatly appreciate your advice regarding her neurological symptoms, whether further imaging would be diagnostically helpful, and if she would benefit from regular follow-up with a neurologist.\n\nThank you very much for considering our referral.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

The patient, a [age] year old male, was admitted to [hospital name] on [date] following a tonic-clonic seizure. He was found to have low magnesium after starting Omeprazole 40mg QDS. The magnesium was replaced IV, and omeprazole changed to ranitidine. He returned back to normal and was discharged.\n\nHowever, since his discharge, the patient has become increasingly confused, restless, and aggressive, with reports of visual hallucinations. He also complained of dysuria, and on admission to ED, he reported experiencing visual hallucinations, associated with a headache. The patient was reviewed by the psychiatric team who found him to be floridly psychotic. He clearly lacked capacity and became increasingly aggressive, requiring IM haloperidol, and eventually 5mg IV of haloperidol.\n\nThe patient was intubated and ventilated to allow for a repeat CT Brain and lumbar puncture, as there is suspicion of encephalitis.\n\nPlease advise on further investigations and management of this patient.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

The patient has also reported reduced sensation bilaterally in her legs, with no obvious dermatomal pattern, equal on both sides. She has good vascular perfusion bilaterally, and her catheter is in situ, with a BNO scheduled for a week (normal for her).\n\nWe have consulted with orthopedics in regards to her condition, and they have arranged for a lumbar x-ray. However, they have also requested that we ask neurology to consult the patient, offering further investigation to determine the extent of the nerve palsy, any underlying causes of the numbness, or any potential complications. Your help in this case would be much appreciated.\n\nThank you for your time and cooperation.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

He was previously independent and living alone until he was admitted on 19-1-18 after being found collapsed in his bathroom. On admission, he was agitated with confused speech and was initially treated for encephalitis. After his condition worsened, he was admitted to ICU on 21-1-18, where he was intubated and started on leviteracetam due to subclinical seizures being suspected. Imaging with CT and MRI revealed no clear cause for this presentation. \n\nThe patient was reviewed on 30-1-18 by Dr. Page, who suggested that the patient most likely had a metabolic encephalopathy. After being transferred from ITU to a medical ward, the patient became chesty with a raised temperature and was treated for a ventilator-acquired pneumonia briefly. However, the patient deteriorated further, and it was decided to palliate him.\n\nOver the past week, the patient has shown signs of improvement as he has become more alert and started speaking. Therapy has been initiated, and there are concerns about the neurological and functional recovery of this previously independent man. After discussing his case with our consultant, it was decided that your expertise would be of benefit. \n\nWe would greatly appreciate your review and any further advice you could give us.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

While the patient had a history of epilepsy as a child, they are currently not on epilepsy medication.\n\nThe patient presented to our hospital on July 14, 2016, with two episodes of collapse and unconsciousness during the day, without warning symptoms. The longest episode lasted for 30 minutes. On examination, the patient's pulse was regular, and there was no evidence of neurological issues, and their examination and bloods were unremarkable. A pacemaker check showed sinus rhythm at 65 bpm, with no arrhythmias.\n\nThe patient had an episode of unresponsiveness during their admission while sitting in a chair, lasting five minutes. They were maintaining their airway and were nil of note cardiovascularly, but with a GCS of 3-15. They were resisting eye opening and actively resisting an NP airway. There was no evidence of seizure activity, although their lower limbs were shaking. The patient woke up after five minutes and proceeded to have a normal conversation with their husband.

Recently, she has had a six-day history of lower back pain accompanied by numbness in an L1-L5 distribution bilaterally and a 24-hour history of faecal and urinary incontinence. \n\nDuring my examination of [Patient Name], I noted that she had power 4-5 throughout all lower limb muscle groups, reflexes 2+ bilaterally throughout, plantars downgoing, normal abdominal reflex, normal anal tone, sensory loss over L2-L5, and perianally. She is also tender on palpation of her lumbar spine, especially with some paraspinal tenderness to a lesser extent. Although she has had two MRIs of her lumbar spine on the 18th and 19th of March that showed no evidence of cauda equina, a broad-based disc bulge was noted at the level of L4-L5, with no obvious herniation of the nucleus pulposus. Effacement of the epidural fat also noted anteriorly. No neurological compromise was identified.\n\nGiven the severity of her condition, I would greatly appreciate your assessment and recommendation regarding her diagnosis and further investigations-management. The patient is eager to find a solution to her symptoms as they have greatly impacted her quality of life. \n\nThank you in advance for your time and effort in treating [Patient Name].\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

The patient is an 88 year old lady who is presenting with several concerning symptoms, including epileptic episodes, delusions, and disorientation.\n\nThe patient's episodes are unusual, as she can appear to be her usual self one moment and then suddenly become agitated, distressed, and even aggressive the next. Her speech during these episodes is rambling and nonsensical, and she has even become suicidal at times. The episodes tend to last for about two hours and always end with a blinding headache and drowsiness.\n\nAdditionally, the patient has been experiencing migrainous episodes with visual changes and photophobia, which have been increasing in frequency over the past few months.\n\nGiven the patient's age and the complexity of her symptoms, I believe that a referral to a specialist such as yourself is necessary to ensure that she receives the best possible care.

On admission, the patient presented with an atypical presentation for stroke: headaches preceding presentation by about two weeks and preceding reclusive behavior. On the day of presentation, the patient's behavior was abnormal and was found locked in the bath without any bath-water. Non-fluent aphasia was observed on admission, with no sensory, motor, or visual symptoms elicited.\n\nImaging of the patient showed a hyperintense lesion at the anterior corpus callosum, crossing the midline in addition to the left frontal lesion. The patient was extensively discussed twice at the Poole Wednesday morning neuro-radiology meeting. On the Gad MRI, the patient was thought to have bilateral anterior cerebrals, on subsequent imaging arranged by medics, was thought to have an underdeveloped right ant cerebral and so possibly unilateral ant cir supply. On the last neuro-rad MDT discussion, LP was suggested (of note LP was attempted prior to this several times on the ward, though unsuccessful, and the patient was reluctant for re-attempts).\n\nPlease see the patient before Tuesday 27 March.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

This lady had a traumatic fall down 15 steps and hit her head, from which she recovered. However, 12 days ago, she developed left leg pain that shot from her lower back down to her foot. Gradually, over a period of 1-5 days, she developed weakness in her left leg to the point where she was having to drag it along and had two falls. Furthermore, she developed weakness and numbness in her left arm but was still able to move it. Three to seven days ago, she developed complete loss of vision in her left eye, which returned to blurred vision. Upon attending our hospital, she had a normal MRI brain and spine, and a normal eye examination. Unfortunately, she self-discharged prior to the neuro review due to issues with the ward staff. \n\nToday, upon examination, we noted patchy decreased sensation in the left side of her face, left hand, and minimal decreased sensation in her left forearm. Her left leg had decreased power of 2-5, and she experienced shooting pain upon passive left ankle flexion and leg raise. Her eye movements and CN examination were normal. After reassurance that a structural cause had been excluded, we started her on gabapentin for the nerve-type pain and asked our physio team to review her. We are unsure if this maybe a functional weakness or if any further investigation or treatment is needed, which is why we are seeking your expertise in this matter. \n\nCould you please review the patient and provide recommendations on how to proceed appropriately? \n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely, \n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

Mrs XXXX was admitted to our hospital on 1-7 with a short history of worsening L sided upper and lower limb weakness. She has been struggling to mobilise from living room to toilet with zimmer frame and assistance, despite usually mobilising independently at home with a walking stick. She has increased tone and reduced power on the L side, with no other focal neurology, and there is no evidence of infection. Mrs XXXX has presented similarly in December 2015, where she spent a 2 month admission on Portland ward for rehab. We believe that a neurology opinion of her current condition, further investigations, and management, would be of great benefit.

The patient was admitted to our hospital on 19-1-18 after being found collapsed in his bathroom. Though he was previously independent and living alone, he appeared agitated and had confused speech when he was first admitted, and was treated for encephalitis. He was then transferred to ICU when his condition worsened and he was unable to maintain his airway. He was then intubated and started on leviteracetam. After further testing, it was discovered that he had a metabolic encephalopathy, and he was extubated and transferred to a medical ward. However, he developed a ventilator acquired pneumonia shortly thereafter and was briefly treated before his condition worsened further. Although he was eventually palliated and showed no signs of neurological or functional recovery, he recently began to speak more and has shown some minor progress.

He returned to normal functioning and resumed working full time. However, he recently described having three episodes of focal seizures that involved flashing lights in his left visual field, left-sided facial numbness, and head jerking towards the left. These episodes lasted approximately 30 seconds. Following these episodes, he had a generalised tonic-clonic seizure which lasted about 5 minutes and self-terminated before the ambulance crew arrived.\n\nBesides his convulsions, Mr. [INSERT NAME] appeared to be feeling well when he presented to our clinic. He had no focal neurology at the time. Dr. Cossburn has advised us to commence Mr. [INSERT NAME] on Lamotrigine 25mg OD, increasing it fortnightly to 75mg BD.

Mrs. Jane Doe is an 85-year-old woman who had a Primary Frontal ICH in May 2018. After this event, there were no post-stroke seizures until she had another acute ICH in September 2018. \n\nFollowing the second event, Mrs. Doe began to have focal seizures on her right side. She was initially treated with Lamotrigine, which was later switched to Levetiracetam 250mg twice a day. Recently, she started to have another right-sided focal seizure, with twitching of her right arm, which did not resolve over 15 minutes. \n\nMrs. Doe was loaded with Phenytoin on arrival, and her keppra was subsequently increased to 500mg twice a day on 5-1-18. A CT scan of her brain also revealed subacute infarct involving the left middle cerebral artery territory.\n\nI am writing to seek advice on the management and treatment of Mrs. Doe's seizures. Can we increase the dose of keppra prior to her being on it for 2-52 at that dose?\n\nI have attached all relevant medical reports and test results for your review.

This patient was admitted with left leg pain and weakness and numbness in her left arm, along with loss of sight in her left eye.\n\nHer background is significant for a traumatic fall down 15 steps and hitting her head, but had recovered from that. However, recently she developed left leg pain and then left leg weakness, which gradually progressed to the point of dragging her leg along and having falls. The patient has also developed weakness and numbness in the left arm, which has yet to interfere with arm movement. Loss of vision in the left eye occurred 3-7 days ago, which has now returned to blurred vision.\n\nThe patient attended RBH having a normal MRI of the brain, the whole spine and normal eye examination. However, she had self-discharged prior to neuro review, thus presenting to Poole with leg weakness. On examination today, she has patchy decreased sensation in the left side of her face and left hand, and minimal decreased sensation in the left forearm, which is patchy as well. Lower limb power is decreased (2-5), and there is shooting pain on passive left ankle flexion and leg raise.\n\nGiven these findings, I think that it is important to evaluate the patient for functional weakness or any other necessary investigation or medical treatment. Gabapentin has been prescribed for the nerve type pain, and the physiotherapist has been asked to review.\n\nThank you for taking the time to review this patient's case.

The patient had a total of four generalised seizures in the last 24 hours, witnessed by pub staff and ambulance crew. The patient sustained an injury to the nose during the first seizure and experienced post-ictal symptoms. On arrival, the patient had a GCS of 15, but later experienced vomiting and another seizure that took ten minutes to recover from. The patient is now aware, eating and drinking, but has a poor recollection of the events and is not orientated in time. He claimed to have had a seizure one year ago. There is a possibility of alcohol dependence, and the patient has been started on a reducing regime of chlordiazepoxide and pabrinex. However, the Alcohol Clinical Treatment Services (ACTS) team does not believe he is alcohol dependent as he only consumes three beers per day. We recommend further evaluation and management by a specialist, including appropriate investigations and a review of his medication regimen. We appreciate the prompt management and care of our patient and look forward to your expert guidance on his ongoing evaluation and care. Thank you.

He did not remember the events and had no prodromal symptoms. There was no history of previous seizure. CT Brain was performed which showed no change in the size of the left MCA aneurysm. Since he was discharged his family noticed him to become increasingly confused with reports of visual hallucinations. He became more restless and aggressive and was brought to ED. On admission, he reported having visual hallucinations since discharge associated with a headache. There was no history of fever. Throughout the day he became increasingly confused and agitated. He absconded from the hospital and was brought back by a passing paramedic. He was reviewed by the psychiatric team who found him to be floridly psychotic with disorientation and paranoid delusions. He clearly lacked capacity and became increasingly aggressive. He was given IM haloperidol 2.5mg initially which had little effect, so a MET Call was put out. On arrival, he was needing a lot of encouragement and restraint to keep him in his room, and was grabbing his head and rolling around. He was therefore given 5mg IV of haloperidol and his friend was then able to calm him somewhat. He was then brought up to ITU where he was Intubated and Ventilated to allow for a repeat CT Brain and Lumbar puncture.

The patient, [Patient Name], was admitted to our hospital on 1-9-15 following a tonic-clonic seizure that was thought to be secondary to a low magnesium after starting Omeprazole 40mg QDS. CT Brain was performed which showed no change in the size of the left MCA aneurysm, apart from a slight increase in calcification. There was no change elsewhere, but a small old right parietal infarct was noted. Since he was discharged, his family noticed him to become increasingly confused with reports of visual hallucinations. He became more restless and aggressive, so was brought to ED. He was reviewed by the psychiatric team who found him to be floridly psychotic and disorientated in time, place and person, as well as paranoid. He also appeared to be experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations. He clearly lacked capacity and became increasingly aggressive, requiring haloperidol for treatment.\n\nWe would appreciate your expertise in further investigating and managing this complex case, including advising on further investigations and management.

This patient was admitted to Ansty after experiencing a tonic-clonic seizure, which was later determined to be a result of low magnesium tied to the use of Omeprazole 40mg QDS. CT Brain revealed an unchanged aneurysm, and magnesium was replaced with intravenous treatment while Omeprazole was switched to Ranitidine. Following his discharge and return to normal, he began experiencing visual hallucinations and increasing confusion. He was brought back to ED after becoming restless and aggressive, with family reporting continual worsening of his condition. Upon admission, the patient reported visual hallucinations alongside headaches, and his condition continued to deteriorate throughout the day. He absconded from the hospital and was later found by passing paramedics, alert but disorientated and aggressive. The psychiatric team found him to be floridly psychotic, displaying thought disorders, disorientation in time, place, and person, and paranoid ideations, alongside hallucinations. He appeared to lack capacity and became increasingly violent, requiring treatment with IM haloperidol before being transferred to ICU for intubation and further testing of his condition.\n\nGiven the patient's recent presentation of acute psychiatric symptoms in addition to his history of seizure and other medical conditions, I kindly ask that you advise on further investigations and care for this patient.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Referring Physician] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

Ms. ______'s background includes having MS in remission, and her cervical spine tumour was removed in April 2014 at SGH. Subsequently, she developed a pulmonary embolism, bowel perforation, and DVT in the left leg. She underwent seven weeks of spinal rehabilitation at Salisbury hospital.\n\nRecently, Ms. ______ presented with a 10-day history of feeling unwell, shivery, and weak in both arms and legs. This has since worsened with progressive weakness of both legs. There has been no change in bowel or urinary habits. Tone has increased in both lower limbs, and she has power 1-2-5 in both lower limbs. Plantars are downgoing, and sensation is normal.\n\nThe case has been discussed with Neurosurgery in Southampton, and MRI results suggest that Ms. ______ requires further contrast studies. The concern is related to her MS - demyelination, which requires a neurology review.\n\nI hope that you can assist in Ms. ______'s care and look forward to your advice.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?
