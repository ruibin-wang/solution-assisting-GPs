Mr XXXX has a complicated medical history, including spinocerebellar disease and associated deafness, which have made it difficult to carry out a comprehensive assessment of his condition. In particular, his poor swallow has resulted in concerns about his nutritional status, and we are trying to arrange an IMCA to carry out a best interests meeting with regard to a potential NJT. However, we are uncertain whether this would be in Mr XXXX's best interests, given his malnourished and frail state. We would be grateful if you could provide us with your expert opinion regarding Mr XXXX's prognosis and any potential long-term implications of his diagnosis.

He was admitted to our hospital on 1-9-15 following a tonic-clonic seizure which was thought to be secondary to a low magnesium after starting Omeprazole 40mg QDS. He did not remember the events and had no prodromal symptoms. He had no history of previous seizures. A CT Brain was performed which showed no change in the size of the left MCA aneurysm, apart from a slight increase in calcification. Magnesium was replaced IV and Omeprazole was changed to Ranitidine. He returned back to normal and was discharged. However, since his discharge, his family noticed him becoming increasingly confused with reports of visual hallucinations. He became more restless and aggressive, and was brought to the ED. On admission, he reported having visual hallucinations since discharge associated with a headache. There was no history of fever. He had no speech-visual disturbance, no focal weakness in extremities, no history of SOB-cough-night sweats, and no history abdominal pain, but was complaining of some dysuria. Throughout the day, he became increasingly confused and agitated. He absconded from the hospital, very unsteady and unsafe on feet, aggressive, and difficult to manage. He was seen by a passing paramedic who knew the patient and was able to calm him and bring him back to the hospital. He was reviewed by the psychiatric team who found him to be floridly psychotic with thought disorders, disorientation in time, place, and person, as well as paranoia (believing staff wanted to harm him). He also appeared to be experiencing auditory and visual hallucinations. He clearly lacked capacity and became increasingly aggressive. He was given IM Haloperidol 2.5mg initially, but this had little effect so at MET call was put out. On arrival, he was needing a lot of encouragement and restraint to keep him in his room, and was grabbing and his head and rolling around. He was therefore given 5mg IV of Haloperidol, and his friend was then able to calm him somewhat. He was then brought up to ITU where he was intubated and ventilated to allow for a repeat CT Brain and Lumbar puncture for possible encephalitis. \n\nWe would be grateful for your advice on further investigations and management of this patient.

We are referring him to your clinic to assess and manage his epilepsy condition effectively.\n\nAt the hospital, we noted that he manifested odd behaviors and confusion, and upon examination, he suffered three general tonic-clonic seizures. He was subsequently given 10mg diazepam by the paramedics, and we loaded him with IV phenytoin while in the ED resus. Due to his condition's severity, he was intubated and ventilated, and referred to the ITU team.\n\nAfter two days in the ITU, he was discharged and referred back to our hospital for care. Although he experienced stable vital signs following the treatment, our neurology examination revealed chronic dull frontal headaches that previously went unaddressed.

Mrs. Shaw is an 88-year-old lady who has been experiencing strange episodes that could be associated with a migrainous or epileptiform aetiology, as well as more recent periods of severe agitation, rambling speech, and aggression, for which she has no memory.\n\nMrs. Shaw's episodes are unusual, as she can apparently present as her usual self, but then very suddenly there is a change, involving agitation, distress, and aggression. At times, she has appeared suicidal. Her speech during these episodes is rambling and apparently nonsensical. It has tended to last for around two hours, and on occasions, she has needed to be restrained whilst this is going on. These episodes always end with her developing a \u201cblinding headache\u201d and then feeling very drowsy. She has also developed psychotic symptoms, with delusions that her family and other people are attempting to kill her. It was unclear whether she developed these thoughts during the period of altered awareness or not. Once it resolves, she has no recollection of what has happened.\n\nOver a few months, she has been developing strange episodes that may have a migrainous aetiology. She tends to feel something coming on, and it is unpleasant. She develops photophobia, needs the curtains to be drawn, and experiences visual changes, seeing zig-zag lines. She described this as if it is all around her and seen with both eyes. The episodes have tended to last for about 20 minutes and then quite swiftly \u201clift.\u201d In between times, she has felt fine. These episodes have been coming on with increasing frequency. She was having them on a daily basis, and then in the lead-up to her admission, they started happening several times per day. They are not associated with a headache.\n\nMrs. Shaw has no past history of mental health problems. There is no family history of psychiatric illness or dementia.\n\nThe psychiatry liaison doctor who reviewed Mrs. Shaw feels that it is more likely that she is suffering from a neurological condition rather than a psychiatric one. It is possible that the brief events she has experienced prior to admission had a migrainous aetiology, though this could also have been epileptiform. The more recent episodes of severe agitation, rambling speech, and aggression (for which she has no memory) always end with a severe headache followed by drowsiness, which could be partial seizure activity. Post-ictal confusion might account for the development of delusional beliefs and associated distress. The focus on three words may be linked to this as well. Either way, he thinks that this requires further investigation.\n\nWe would be grateful if you could review Mrs. Shaw for a possible neurological cause for her symptoms and advise on further investigations and management of this patient. Please contact me if you require further information.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nKind regards,\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

She presents with episodes of agitation, distress, and aggression, along with rambling and nonsensical speech, which last for about 2 hours before ending with a \"blinding headache\" and drowsiness. She has also developed delusions that her family and other individuals are attempting to kill her. These episodes occur suddenly and without warning. Additionally, she has experienced strange episodes with migrainous or epileptiform etiology, including photophobia, visual changes, and zig-zag lines. She is not experiencing headaches during these episodes, but they have been increasing in frequency. Her family has no history of psychiatric illness or dementia.\n\nAfter consulting with the psychiatry liaison, it is believed that this patient's symptoms are more likely attributed to neurological conditions, rather than psychiatric diagnoses. The episodes of agitation and speech changes, especially when ending with a severe headache and drowsiness, may indicate partial seizure activity or post-ictal confusion. The focus on three words may also be linked to this.

The review by liason psychiatry noted the patient being extremely blunted in affect secondary to psychotic depression.

On one occasion, the attack was witnessed by his cousin in which he was shaking all 4 limbs, lasting for approximately 10 minutes.\n\n[Patient Name] was admitted on the 17th May due to a further 'attack' at work. He does not remember the attack but recalls feeling disorientated for 1 hour post-event, biting his tongue and lacerating his right eye. He also reports to have experienced a similar episode at work 3 weeks ago. On a daily basis, [Patient Name] experiences sensations of shaking and jerking which begins in his left leg and travels to the rest of his body. They can sometimes last all day and sometimes, he can control them. He denies any drug or alcohol abuse.\n\n[Patient Name] is currently due for a neurology clinic review in July, but due to the recurrent episodes, I would be very grateful for your review and advice on whether to start anticonvulsant therapy. Please could you provide your assessment and recommendations for further investigations and management.\n\nThank you for your help and expertise.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Your Name] Which of the following does this referral letter refer to?

An MRI C-spine showed only spondylitic changes, with no evidence of infective discs, and no compressive myelopathy or cord compression.\n\nAn LP was performed on 15-04-18, which was documented as traumatic, with the first bottle being blood-stained, showing a CSF protein level of 1.74 - Cell Count: WBC (Bottle 1) <1 X 10^6-L RBC (Bottle 1) 722 X 10^6-L WBC (Bottle 3) <1 X 10^6-L RBC (Bottle 3) 35 X 10^6-L.
